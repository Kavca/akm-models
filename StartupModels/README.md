# Startup Models directory

## Introduction

This directory contains AKM Startup Models. Startup Models intent to be a collection of models that can be used to start a project, and is also good for learning about and testing AKM Modelling.

AKM Models organized in project.json files.
Each project.json file contains models and metamodels.

## Naming Conventions

We recommend to use a naming convention for models like:

"ModelArea/Domain/Owner"-"ModelName"-"ModelVariant"

We use "-" as a separator between parts of the name.
CamelCase is used for several words in same part.

i.e.

- "Kavca-IspimScooterRental-Workshop"
- "Equinor-OSDU-AkmPoc"
