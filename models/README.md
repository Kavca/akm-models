## Naming Conventions

We recommend to use a naming convention for models like:

"ModelArea/Domain/Owner"-"ModelName"-"ModelVariant"

We use "-" as a separator between parts of the name.
CamelCase is used for several words in same part.

i.e.

- "kavca-ispimScooterRental-workshop"
- "osdu-akm-models
  "
