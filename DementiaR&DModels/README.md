## Naming Conventions

We recommend to use a naming convention for models like:

"ModelArea/Domain/Owner"-"ModelName"-"ModelVariant"

We use "-" as a separator between parts of the name.
CamelCase is used for several words in same part.

i.e.

- "Kavca-IspimScooterRental-Workshop"
- "Equinor-Cumulus-AkmPoc"
